## ABOUT

Datacamp is a Web application for publishing, searching and managing data
in form of datasets.

## QUICKSTART

````
bin/setup
foreman start
````

This project uses environemt variables for configuration. See the `.env` file to see what is available. If you need to override some variable for development and that change is specific to your machine and should not concern other developers, create a `.env.local` file and add the variable there. `.env.local` is gitignored by default.

## DEPLOYMENT

1. Provision a server using the provided ansible scripts.

2. On the server, set up application environment in `.bashrc`. Start by copying
   all variables from `.env` and change them as needed. It is important that

   - the variables are exported to subprocesses, i.e., (unlike in `.env`) start
     each line with export. For example `export DATANEST_MYSQL_PASSWORD=pass`.
   - the exports are placed at the very top of the `.bashrc` file, before the
     check that skips loading the rest of the file in non-interactive session
     (that means both capistrano and passenger)

      ````bash
      # ~/.bashrc: executed by bash(1) for non-login shells.
      # see /usr/share/doc/bash/examples/startup-files (in the package bash-doc)
      # for examples
      
      export DATANEST_MYSQL_HOST=localhost
      export DATANEST_MYSQL_PORT=3306
      # [more exports ...]
      
      # If not running interactively, don't do anything
      case $- in
          *i*) ;;
            *) return;;
      esac
      
      # [rest of the .bashrc]
      ````

3. For the first time, run `cap production deploy:cold`. This will create
   databases and import schemas. This should only be called once and in the
   first deploy. Otherwise run `cap production deploy`.

4. Optionally, to import database dumps, first download them on your
   development machine and run `cap production deploy:import_dump
   DUMP=path/to/datanest_data_dump.sql.gz`. The file will be gzipped
   automatically if not already. Make sure that the dump name start with
   `datanest_$DB` as the name format is used to extract the database name.
