# By default, any exception happening in your Rails application will bubble up
# to Cucumber so that your scenario will fail. This is a different from how
# your application behaves in the production environment, where an error page will
# be rendered instead.
#
# Sometimes we want to override this default behaviour and allow Rails to rescue
# exceptions and display an error page (just like when the app is running in production).
# Typical scenarios where you want to do this is when you test your error pages.
# There are two ways to allow Rails to rescue exceptions:
#
# 1) Tag your scenario (or feature) with @allow-rescue
#
# 2) Set the value below to true. Beware that doing this globally is not
# recommended as it will mask a lot of errors for you!
#


# Remove/comment out the lines below if your app doesn't have a database.
# For some databases (like MongoDB and CouchDB) you may need to use :truncation instead.
# begin
#   DatabaseCleaner.strategy = :transaction
# rescue NameError
#   raise "You need to add database_cleaner to your Gemfile (in the :test group) if you wish to use it."
# end

# You may also want to configure DatabaseCleaner to use different strategies for certain features and scenarios.
# See the DatabaseCleaner documentation for details. Example:
#
# Before('@no-txn,@selenium,@culerity,@celerity,@javascript') do
#   DatabaseCleaner.strategy = :truncation, {:except => %w[widgets]}
# end
#
# Before('~@no-txn', '~@selenium', '~@culerity', '~@celerity', '~@javascript') do
#   DatabaseCleaner.strategy = :transaction
# end
#
